To efficiently address the backlog of videos in a video transcoding application, the following scenario could be considered:

1. **Scale Out with Auto-scaling:**
   - Implement an auto-scaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of instances based on the size of the backlog.
   - Set up a metric or threshold that triggers the addition or removal of instances. For example, you might scale out (add instances) when the backlog exceeds a certain limit and scale in (remove instances) when the backlog decreases.
   - This allows you to automatically adapt to changing workloads and efficiently allocate resources as needed.

2. **Fault Tolerance and Resilience:**
   - Design the application with fault-tolerant and resilient features to handle interruptions gracefully.
   - If video processing is interrupted in one instance, ensure that the application can seamlessly resume processing in another instance without losing progress.
   - Use persistent storage or a database to store the processing state, allowing instances to share information and resume work from where it left off.

3. **Priority Queue or Parallel Processing:**
   - Implement a priority queue system that processes high-priority videos first. This ensures that critical or time-sensitive videos are handled promptly.
   - Explore parallel processing to distribute the workload among multiple instances efficiently. Divide the videos into smaller batches, and each instance can work on a separate batch simultaneously.

4. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging to keep track of the processing status, errors, and resource utilization.
   - Use these logs to identify bottlenecks, optimize performance, and make informed decisions about scaling.

5. **Dynamic Resource Allocation:**
   - Utilize cloud-based infrastructure that allows dynamic resource allocation. Cloud platforms often provide services that enable automatic scaling based on demand.
   - Adjust the processing capacity dynamically to handle varying workloads efficiently, reducing costs during periods of lower demand.

6. **Cost Optimization:**
   - Consider the cost implications of scaling. Ensure that the cost of additional instances is justified by the reduction in backlog and overall efficiency gains.
   - Utilize spot instances or reserved instances to optimize costs while maintaining the required processing capacity.

In summary, the most efficient scenario involves a combination of auto-scaling, fault tolerance, priority handling, parallel processing, monitoring, and cost optimization. This approach ensures adaptability to workload changes, resilient handling of interruptions, and efficient resource utilization.
