Arali commonly known as oleander, is a flowering shrub that has been traditionally used in various cultures for medicinal purposes. 
However, it's crucial to note that the plant contains toxic compounds, including oleandrin, and can be deadly if ingested in large quantities. 
Due to its toxicity, the medicinal use of oleander should be approached with extreme caution and preferably under the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional.

Historically, oleander has been associated with potential medicinal properties, but its use is not widely endorsed due to the risks involved. 

Some traditional uses include:
Wound Healing: Oleander extracts have been applied topically to wounds to facilitate healing. However, the potential benefits should be weighed against the toxic effects.
Cardiac Conditions: Certain compounds in oleander have been investigated for their potential in treating heart conditions. Oleandrin, for example, has been 
studied for its effects on cardiac glycosides. However, the risks associated with toxicity limit its application.

It's important to emphasize that the potential therapeutic uses of oleander are largely unproven, and the risks of toxicity are well-documented. 
Ingesting any part of the oleander plant can lead to severe poisoning, affecting the heart and other vital organs.

If you are considering the use of oleander for any medicinal purpose, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional before doing so. 
Self-medication with oleander or any other plant with known toxic properties can have serious consequences and is strongly discouraged. 
Always prioritize the advice of medical experts and rely on scientifically validated treatments for health concerns.
