Betel, scientifically known as Piper betle, is a medicinal plant widely used in traditional medicine, particularly in some Asian countries. 
The leaves of the betel plant are the most commonly utilized part for their therapeutic properties. Here is a brief description of how betel is used and the diseases it is
 believed to help with:

Anti-inflammatory: In traditional medicine, betel is sometimes used for its perceived anti-inflammatory effects, which may be beneficial for certain conditions.
Cautions and Concerns:

Health Risks: Long-term use of betel, especially when combined with tobacco, has been associated with various health risks, including an increased risk of oral cancers and other health issues.
